### Project:
[Machine Learning](https://github.com/JohannaRangel/DS-M6-ML_Automotive_MarketAnalysis): You can't miss this interesting practice. It is about emulating a work environment, from an innovation area where they request to build an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of a Big Data environment.
You can find my exercises in the "Evidence" folder. :zany_face: :upside_down_face: Excellent challenge...
